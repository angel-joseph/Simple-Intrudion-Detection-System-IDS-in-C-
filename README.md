# Simple-Intrudion-Detection-System-IDS-in-C-
The Simple Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a lightweight C++ program designed to simulate the core functionality of a security system that identifies suspicious or malicious activity in log files. This project is ideal for understanding basic cybersecurity concepts like signature-based detection, file parsing, and regular expressions.
Purpose:
The primary goal of this project is to detect potential security threats by analyzing system logs for common attack patterns, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and brute force attempts. The project demonstrates how cybersecurity principles can be implemented programmatically.

Key Features:
Log File Analysis:
Parses log files to extract and analyze entries line by line.

Signature-Based Detection:
Matches log entries against a predefined set of attack signatures using regular expressions.

Alert System:
Generates alerts when suspicious patterns are detected and displays them to the user.

User Interaction:
Prompts the user to specify the log file to scan, enabling flexibility and ease of use.

Extensibility:
New attack signatures can easily be added to enhance the detection capabilities.

Technical Details:
Programming Language: C++

Core Libraries Used:

<iostream> for input/output operations.
<fstream> for file handling.
<regex> for pattern matching.
<unordered_map> for storing attack signatures.
Detection Mechanism:

Utilizes regular expressions to match log entries with suspicious patterns.
Example signatures include SQL Injection (e.g., SELECT * FROM users WHERE '1'='1';) and XSS (e.g., <script>alert('XSS Attack');</script>).
How It Works:
The user provides the name of a log file to scan.
The program reads the file line by line, checking each entry against known attack patterns.
If a match is found, an alert is generated, specifying the type of attack and the line number.
The results are displayed on the console for review.
Sample Output:
plaintext
Copy code
Welcome to the Simple Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
Enter the name of the log file to scan: logs.txt
[ALERT] SQL Injection detected on line 1: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE '1'='1';"
[ALERT] XSS detected on line 2: "<script>alert('XSS Attack');</script>"
[ALERT] Brute Force detected on line 3: "Failed login attempt for user admin."
Scanning completed.
Applications:
Learning Cybersecurity Concepts:
Great for students or beginners looking to understand how IDS systems work.
Log Analysis:
Can be extended for real-world use cases to monitor logs for anomalies.
Prototyping Security Tools:
Acts as a foundation for building more advanced IDS or security tools.
Future Enhancements:
Real-Time Monitoring:
Implement real-time log file monitoring using multithreading.
Anomaly Detection:
Introduce machine learning models to identify unknown attack patterns.
Data Visualization:
Add a graphical interface to visualize detected threats.
Conclusion:
This project offers a hands-on approach to implementing a fundamental cybersecurity tool in C++. It provides a stepping stone for learners and professionals alike to explore more complex topics in intrusion detection and network security.
